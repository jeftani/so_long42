So Long
This project is part of the curriculum at 42 and is intended to be a simple implementation of a game called So Long.

Description
So Long is a 2D game where the player controls a character that needs to collect all the necessary items to complete each level and progress through the game. The game features various enemies and obstacles that the player needs to avoid or defeat in order to reach the end of each level.

The game is written in C and uses the MinilibX library for graphics and input handling.

How to play
To play the game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/so_long.git
cd into the directory: cd so_long
Compile the game: make
Run the game: ./so_long maps/map.ber
The game can be played using the arrow keys to move the player character. The goal of each level is to collect all the necessary items (represented by a "C" on the map) and reach the exit (represented by an "E" on the map).

Maps
The game comes with several maps that can be found in the maps directory. Maps are represented as text files, where each character represents a tile in the game:

0: empty tile
1: wall tile
C: collectible item tile
E: exit tile
P: player character tile
N: enemy character tile
Maps can be edited or new ones can be created by following this format.

MINILIBIX 

MinilibX is a simple graphics library designed for use in educational environments, such as at 42. It was originally developed by Olivier Crouzet and is now maintained by the staff at 42.

MinilibX provides a basic set of functions for drawing simple graphics, such as lines, circles, and rectangles, as well as handling user input events, such as mouse and keyboard events. It is intended to be easy to use and lightweight, making it a good choice for small projects and educational environments.

MinilibX supports both MacOS and Linux platforms, although the installation process may vary slightly between the two. On MacOS, MinilibX can be installed using Homebrew, while on Linux, it may need to be compiled from source.

Overall, MinilibX is a useful library for learning the basics of graphics programming and is a good choice for small projects and educational environments.
